/* When looking at the top charts for 2022, my first instinctual question is what makes it a top song. 
Although we can use sequel to analize this information to get an idea of the answer, this is best seen
through visualization instead of numbers. For that reason, I wanted to shift my focus for this project
and instead see the relationship between artists with the most production of top chart tracks and top 
50 most popular tracks. */
